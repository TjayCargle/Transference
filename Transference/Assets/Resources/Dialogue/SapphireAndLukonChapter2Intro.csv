a,4,Well that was unexpected./setAsFirst:Sapphire Witchcoven/ /setAsSecond:Lukon Redwolf/
a,5,Milday; may I inquire as to the situation?
a,4,Another witch; the pain that she is; decided to unleash hell. Disgusting revenants of all things; yet this will give us the opportunity we need. 
a,4, If I was hiding a spellbook; it would be somewhere in a basement vault.
a,5,Then allow me to lead; I shall be your shield.
-Jail Cell:
a,4,Nothing; nothing; absolutely nothing. 
a,4,I mean; I suppose it wouldn’t be that easy; but then why are these Vampretti guarding this location?
a,5,Perhaps just to protect minor goods? Or something could be hidden here.
a,4,Let me see...interesting. This cell over here is made of anti-magic materials. This could be it; but how do we break it…
-*Guards rush in*
e,0,Who are you!?
a,5,Milday; step back
a,4, Hush; Lukon dear. This will be entertainment; not a threat.
