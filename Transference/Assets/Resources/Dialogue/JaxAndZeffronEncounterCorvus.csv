a,0, We made it!
a,0,Ugh. So many books. Where are we even supposed to start.
a,1,I doubt this place has a librarian on staff to help us find what we’re looking for.
e,5,I’m afraid there’s no one like that here; boys.
-Jax and Zeffron turn around.
-CORVUS RAYVERN; tall; gaunt; imposing; skulks up the aisle.
-He is flanked by Butch & Dahlia.
e,5,But I suppose if you need help; my boys here would be more than happy to oblige you.
a,0,. . .
a,1,Who are you guys?
-Corvus takes a few steps closer.
e,5, A bird by the name of Corvus. I must say; Jax; I’m hurt. Not even telling your friends about your former employer.
e,5,Oh; that's right. If I’m not mistaken; you were supposed to be dead.
a,0,I’m supposed to be a lot of things. For example; right now; I should get going.
-Jax grabs Zeffron and runs for the exit; only to stop short.
-BUTCH; big; mean; dimwitted; trudges up behind them.
e,5, And here’s the man who was meant to kill you. Butch! What the hell am I looking at?
e,1, My apologies; boss. Could’ve sworn I dealt with this one before.
-He cracks his knuckles and steps closer.
e,1,I promise; this time I’ll finish the job.
e,5,Nevermind that; you oaf. If you want something done right...
-Corvus presents his weapon.
e,5,... You do it yourself.
-Jax and Zeffron stand back to back.
a,1, Any grand ideas; Jax?
a,0,Working on it.
-Corvus halts his approach. Something buzzes offscreen.
e,3,What’s that noise?
-The Queen Scorpiee swoops above the aisle.
e,3,Holy crap; a Queen Scorpiee!
e,1,Run for it!
-The two thieves race off.
e,5,Where are you two going?
-He glares at the remaining trio and turns to where the two thieves ran off.
e,5, This isn’t over; you hear me?
-Corvus escapes.
-The Queen Scorpiee hovers in front of Jax and Zeffron.
a,0,Guess that just leaves us; Z.
a,1,So it would seem. Get ready; Jax.
